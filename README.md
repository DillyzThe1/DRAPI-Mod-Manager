# DRAPI Mod Manager
An all in one launcher for all of my Among Us mods, including those of general usage to the API!<br>
*Fun fact: If you open Ctrl + O on the launcher, you'll open the LocalLow folder where the cache and clone is stored!*

# Installation
Head over to the [mod manager's releases page](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DRAPI-Mod-Manager/releases) & download the installer exe.<br>
If windows warns you about the program, remember that this is fully open source so you can read what you don't trust. Just hit run anyway.<br>
Follow through the installation and open up the program (likely through your desktop icon).<br>
Install the client with the "reinstall" button and browse mods.<br>
Hit "launch" and wait for the first boot-up procedure to happen.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
<br>
*Note: you must always launch through the launcher to get the modded variant of Among Us running.*
