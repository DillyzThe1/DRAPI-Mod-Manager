Welcome to DRAPI-Mod-Manager for Windows!
The goal of this program is to add a whole new ease-of-access feel to Among Us mods!
Here, you may easily download and install mods to Among Us I decide to release the moment they're out.
You'll recieve an announcement every time you boot this program up if a new one has been put out.

If you want to list your mod, open an issue on the github page and I'll tag it.
If you have a problem with something in the launcher, open an issue on the github page and tell me about it.
If you have a mod idea you want, either tell me on discord or in the issues page mentioned before.
